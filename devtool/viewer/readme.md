## Execute

To execute this program, use this command:

```./this inputFileName width height fps colorScheme```


where:
- ```./this``` is path to the executable;
- ```inputFileName``` is path to the video file;
- ```width``` Width of the video file in pixel;
- ```height``` Height of the video file in pixel;
- ```fps``` Frame per second of the video file in pixel. In some case, the actual FPS may be lower. For example, the acyual FPS may be 30 when this argument is 90;
