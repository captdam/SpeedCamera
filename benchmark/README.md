# Benchmark

## Stage timestamp

File hwy(hl)n.csv and qew(hl)n.csv contains the timestamp recorded at when the program finishs each stage in the process. "hl" means headless mode (no display stage).

File benchmark\_stage\_worksheet is used to analysis the timestamp files. This file has two sheets: sheet 1 used to enter the timestamp file, sheet 2 used to generate average result for multiple timestamp files.

## Overall process time

File benchmark_overall.csv contains the time to run the algorithm on the scene. Only the overall process time is recorded.
